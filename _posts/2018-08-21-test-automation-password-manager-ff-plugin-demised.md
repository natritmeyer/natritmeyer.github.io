It's rather ironic that the day after restarting this site my inbox is graced with an email from Mozilla informing me that a long-forgotten firefox plugin I wrote more than 5 years ago will no longer be compatible with future versions of the browser:

> You are receiving this email because you are listed as a developer of a legacy add-on on addons.mozilla.org (AMO). Mozilla will stop supporting Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) 52, the final release that is compatible with legacy add-ons, on September 5, 2018. As no supported versions of Firefox will be compatible with legacy add-ons after this date, we will start the process of disabling legacy add-on versions on AMO. On September 6, 2018, submissions for new legacy add-on versions will be disabled. All legacy add-on versions will be disabled by early October 2018. Once this happens, users will no longer be able to find your legacy versions on AMO. 

So long, [test-automation-password-manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/test-automation-password-ma/). You were once useful to many, but today you are consigned to the scrap heap of history.

If for some unfathomable reason you're still using this plugin, sorry.
