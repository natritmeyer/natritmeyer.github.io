    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Matt Robbins of <a href="http://opensourcetester.co.uk/">opensourcetester.co.uk</a> fame has written
a book called <a href="http://bit.ly/16sG932">&ldquo;Application Testing with Capybara&rdquo;</a>, published
by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt</a>.</p>

<p>There are few books I feel I can recommend to those starting off in test automation but this
book is one of them.</p>

<p>Most book begin with the tedious &lsquo;how to install [the software]&rsquo; but by the end of Chapter 1
Matt has taken you on the journey from installing the relevant software to having a fully working
test. If you&rsquo;re the type who wants to get down to business quickly (hello!) then this book is
for you.</p>

<p>As well as giving clear examples of how to deal with each of the types of elements you&rsquo;re likely to
encounter when automating a web UI with Capybara, Matt also explains the often-confusing rules
around finders, scoping and multiple matchers. If you want to better understand how Capybara deals
with finding elements then read this chapter!</p>

<p>A final thing: most tutorials you come across on the web only deal with the simplest use cases.
Instead of avoiding the more difficult scenarios, Matt deals with them head on in the &lsquo;Ninja Topics&rsquo;
chapter. If you&rsquo;re struggling with using Capybara with tools other than cucumber, this is the chapter
for you. If you want to get under capybara&rsquo;s hood, there&rsquo;s lots of good info. Want to use
Capybara with a driver other than Selenium? Everything you need is here :)</p>

<p>So, if you want to learn Capybara, buy yourself a copy of <a href="http://bit.ly/16sG932">&ldquo;Application Testing with Capybara&rdquo;</a>!</p>
